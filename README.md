# StayFocussed

## Project Goal

StayFocussed is a service enabling improved concentration during lectures, more flexible scheduling of breaks, enhanced productivity, unified break start and ends. The complete service was implemented and designed in a two day Hackathon.

Cognitive performance is influenced by multiple factors such as lighting, air quality and individual need for rest. Within the scope of a two day hackathon, our goal was to develop a prototypical solution to improve students’ concentration and productivity during lectures by suggesting breaks and other actions when appropriate. The recommendations are based on human input and real-world data – in our case generated by a sensor infrastructure given at [Herman Hollerith Zentrum](http://www.hhz.de/).

Additionally, our goal was to build a service based on our solution. Therefore, we have applied several scientific methods such as Business Model Canvas, Value Proposition Canvas and Business Process Modeling.
